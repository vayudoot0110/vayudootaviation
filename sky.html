								</h4>

								

								<p>
									Vayudoot Pilot Programme is a Programme where we train students from the first step of their career till heights of the sky. We provide nation’s most meticulous training programmes in the fields of aviation.
								<br>
                                                               While a college degree is not always required to get started in this career field. However, aspiring pilots can gain more relevant knowledge by enrolling in an aviation programme.<br>
                                                                The first step after students complete their 10+2 is RTR(A) and DGCA examinations. DGCA includes Navigation, Meteorology and Regulation.  After the first step students may fly to different countries ( USA, New Zealand, South Africa, Canada, Los Angeles, India) to complete their flying training with their SPL, PPL and CPL.
<br> A good pilot programme provides a plethora for the organisation to prove value and reveal deficiencies before spending significant amount of time, energy or money on a large scale project. Typically, a pilot programme begins with a proposal that lists the objectives of the pilot programme and documents how the programme will be carried out. The documentation should also provide a time-line for the pilot and metrics for how success will be determined. The time it takes to move on to an airline after you complete the professional pilot training programme will also depend on how often you fly, but most people can gain the required 1500 hours within a year or two after earning a flight instructor certificate, making your total time to go from zero to airline pilot about three to four years.
                                                                <br><br><br>

									<a href="" class="tit9">STARTING A PILOT PROGRAMME</a> </h4>	
								<p>Willing to launch and learn how to start a pilot programme? After you’ve decided on the technology you want to test, you can start channelizing your programme with these steps:</p><br>
<h4><font color="red">SET CLEAR AIM :-</font></h4><br>

<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
  <li>- When you get started with your pilot, you need to be clear on your aims and objectives for the new technology and what you’re striving to fulfil</li>
 
</ul> <br><br>

<h4><font color="red">TIME MANAGEMENT :-</font></h4><br>

<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
  <li>- Once you’ve figured out your objectives and about the technology, you’ll need to on how will you manage the time it will need to run. Consider how long you would need to put the new technology through its routine use case, including any set up time. It is essential to make use of technology as it will normally be used in a day-to-day setting, but to also allow time to test for additional use cases or try out features that you may not need as usual. All of this testing will enable you to make a more informed decision.</li>
  
</ul> <br><br>

<h4><font color="red">EVOLVE A PLAN FOR BOARDING :-</font></h4><br>

<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
  <li>- The on boarding plan that you merge when you begin to run your pilot programme can be used when the technology is rolled out to the rest of the department or organization, so do not skip this step. Conduct training and resources throughout the programme to help candidates get comfortable using it. Technology has been one of the leading chauffeur until now. Your adoption rates are more likely to be positive if you have a successful pilot programme.</li>
  
  
</ul> <br><br>

<h4><font color="red">GAIN FEEDBACK :-</font></h4><br>

<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
  <li>- The pilot really is a chance for trial and error, so find out what worked and what didn’t. Especially if you plan to barge out the new technology on a large scale, you should be able to troubleshoot issues that came up during the pilot programme. The feedback from your candidates will be essential in helping to evaluate if the new technology will move forward, or if you need to find an alternative for that. Provide candidates the chance to share feedback throughout the process, as well as at the end through group discussions, surveys, or self assessment. Assessing this data, measuring alongside that how well you have reached your goals, will give you the information you need to take decision if the technology was a success and should continue to be used.</li>

</ul> <br><br>
